# Scalable Neural Network

The goal of this project is to create an architecture for a feed forward neural network that can be easily scaled.

File Guide
- main.py
  - contains easy-to-scale neural network structure
  - can create feedforward neural network using the adaline function
- hard-code_241.py
  - a hardcoded neural network (build for XOR) with one hidden layer
  - reference for hard-coded backprop
- sandbox.py
  - ignore--for experimental purposes
  
  # Note
  
  Backprop 'paths' need to be checked. Currently getting sub-optimal results with many hidden layers.
